# Webpack Code Splitting Example

This is a small sample app that shows how to perform code splitting in Webpack. To install, simply clone the repo and `npm install`. From here, you can go with any number of commands:

- To do a dev build, run `npm run dev`.
- To generate an optimized production build, run `npm run build`.
- To run the app on a local server, run `npm start`, and the app will be available at http://localhost:8080/

The master branch does not properly split code, because master is the starting point. To see how code splitting works, check out the [code-split](https://github.com/malchata/webpack-tree-shaking-example/tree/code-split) branch.

Hope you find this useful!
